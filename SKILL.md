# Conversion Copy Review

Expert copywriting analysis for mobile apps (especially AI-powered) and SaaS products targeting technical audiences.

## Review Framework

Analyze copy across these dimensions:

### 1. Clarity for Technical Audiences
- **Immediate value**: Can users understand what this does in 3 seconds?
- **Technical accuracy**: Are AI/tech claims precise and honest?
- **Jargon balance**: Technical enough to be credible, clear enough to be understood
- **Bias detection**: Flag any copy that could generate biased or extreme AI responses

### 2. Mobile-First Optimization
- **Thumb-zone CTAs**: Primary actions within easy reach
- **Scannable hierarchy**: Key info visible without scrolling
- **Sentence length**: Max 15-20 words for mobile
- **Touch target size**: Buttons large enough, properly spaced

### 3. Conversion Psychology
- **Specificity**: "Save 3 hours/week" > "Save time"
- **Loss aversion**: Frame value around avoiding pain
- **Social proof**: Place testimonials near friction points
- **Cognitive fluency**: Short sentences, active voice, clear structure

### 4. AI Product Messaging
- **Capability clarity**: What the AI actually does vs. doesn't do
- **Trust building**: Address AI concerns (privacy, accuracy, control)
- **Avoid overpromising**: No "revolutionary" or "magical" claims without proof
- **Bias awareness**: Ensure inclusive, neutral language about AI capabilities

### 5. Critical Copy Elements
Review these specific areas:
- **Headlines**: Lead with transformation, not features
- **CTAs**: Action-verb first, benefit-driven, low commitment language
- **Value props**: Specific outcomes for technical users
- **Product descriptions**: Features translated to benefits
- **Hero sections**: Hook + value + CTA in first screen
- **Pricing pages**: Clear, transparent, objection-handling

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand Context
Quickly assess:
- Product type (AI app, SaaS, tool)
- Target users (developers, tech-adjacent, technical decision-makers)
- Primary goal (signup, purchase, engagement)
- Input format (screenshot, Figma, text)

### Step 2: Score & Identify Issues
Provide:
- **Conversion Score**: X/10 with justification
- **Critical Issues**: 3-5 highest-impact problems (prioritized)
- **Bias/Safety Flags**: Any problematic AI messaging

### Step 3: Section-by-Section Analysis
For each section:
```
**Current:** [exact copy]
**Issues:** [specific problems]
**Rewrite:** [direct suggestion - no hedging]
**Why:** [conversion principle]
```

### Step 4: Prioritized Recommendations
- **High impact, low effort**: Quick wins
- **High impact, high effort**: Strategic rewrites
- **A/B test ideas**: Specific elements worth testing

## Key Principles

### Headlines
- Lead with outcome: "Ship AI features faster" > "AI development platform"
- Use numbers: "3x faster deployment" > "faster deployment"
- Avoid questions unless they trigger "yes"
- Test: Would this stop a technical user's scroll?

### CTAs
- Verb-first: "Start building" > "Get started"
- Show value: "Try free for 14 days" > "Sign up"
- Remove friction: "No credit card" when true
- Mobile-appropriate: "Get app" > "Download our application"

### AI-Specific Copy
- **Be specific**: "Analyzes code patterns" > "Uses AI"
- **Address concerns**: Privacy, accuracy, human oversight
- **Show limitations**: "Suggests fixes" > "Fixes all bugs automatically"
- **Avoid hype**: Skip "revolutionary", "game-changing", "magical"

### Technical Audience
- **Use technical terms correctly**: Don't dumb down unnecessarily
- **Show, don't tell**: Code samples, metrics, specific examples
- **Respect intelligence**: No patronizing explanations
- **Provide depth**: Link to technical docs, API references

## Common Conversion Killers

Flag immediately:
- ❌ "World-class", "leading", "innovative" without proof
- ❌ Vague AI claims: "Powered by AI" without explaining what it does
- ❌ Passive CTAs: "Be started" vs "Start"
- ❌ Company-focused: "We're proud" vs "You'll achieve"
- ❌ Biased language: Check for demographic assumptions
- ❌ Overpromising AI: "Perfect", "never wrong", "eliminates all errors"
- ❌ Hidden limitations: Disclose what AI can't do
- ❌ Generic benefits: "Better experience" without specifics

## Bias & Safety Checks

For AI products, flag copy that:
- Makes absolute claims AI can't deliver ("100% accurate")
- Ignores potential bias in AI outputs
- Suggests AI replaces human judgment entirely
- Uses demographic assumptions
- Creates unrealistic expectations
- Lacks transparency about limitations

**When detected**: Note early in review, suggest neutral alternatives.
